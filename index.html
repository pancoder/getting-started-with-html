Intro to the Web: Notes <br>
<p>The Web was born in the  1990's. The World Wide Web is made up of HTML documents connected by <b><em>hyperlinks</em></b> thus creating a web of documents that are stored on servers all around the world. The servers communicate to each other through a <b><em>protocal</em></b> such as <b>HTTP.</b></p> 
  
<p><b><em>What is HTML?</em></b></p>
  1. The text that you see<br>
  2. Mark up language that determines what the page looks like.<br>
  3. Reference to other documents<br>
4. References to other pages. <br>

<b>Markup</b><br>
A markup code is called an <b><em>Element.</em></b><br>
Looks like: (left arrow)<b>name</b>(/right arrow)<b>contents</b>(left arrow)<b>name</b>(/right arrow)<br>

<p>Question: How do I type out the left and right arrow in HTML if I want to see them printed out and not as a part of code?</p>

Self-Answer: You need entities! Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities. <br>
The left angled bracket entity is: 	& + l + t + ;  (omit the plus signs) <br>
The right angled bracket entity is: & + g + t + ; (omit the plus signs). <br>
Here it is in action: 
&lt; and &gt; <br>

Characters, not present on your keyboard, can also be replaced by entities.<br>

<p><b>Tags</b></p>
Tags are what you type before and after each markup instruction. There is an opening tag and a closing tag.  It is a good habbit to create both the opening and closing tag at the same time so you don't forget.<br> Note: When you are writing code there is no need for spaces between the content and the open or closed tags.

<p><b>Attributes</b></p>
Attributes are element modifiers with a "value" that changes the content enclosed in an element.<br>
Attribuites look like: &lt;<b>tag ATTR="value"</b>&gt;<b>content</b> &lt;<b>tag</b>&gt;<br>

<p><b>Creating Links</b><br>
  
  An <b>Anchor tag</b> is an attribute that is used for making links. </p>

Example: &lt;a href="value"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;<br><br>
<a href="http://www.udacity.com/playground">Visit Udacity HTML editor!</a>

Note: you must include the space between the <b>a</b> and the <b>href.</b><br>

<b>Images</b><br>
&lt;img src="url" alt= "text"&gt;<br>
Example: <h2>Spectacular Mountain</h2>
<img src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:304px;height:228px;"> <br><br>

Question: What is a void tag?<br>
Self-Answer: A void tag is the kind of tag that does not requre a close tag.  Most HTML elements require an open and closed tag. Void or Empty tags are exceptions to that rule because they, in themselves, do not have conent.  So a <b>Break</b> tag &lt;br&gt; is a void tag.

<p><b>In-line elements vs. Block elements</b></p>
HTML elements can be 'In-Line' or 'Block'. Block elements create an invisible box around the content.<br><br>
Example: &lt;b&gt; ,&lt;em&gt;,&lt;img&gt;,and &lt;br&gt; are inline elements. 
&lt;p&gt; ,&lt;/p&gt;,&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; are block elements

  How to make secret comments to yourself...
<!-- This line is an HTML comment. -->
<!-- Comments help PEOPLE read code. They are ignored by the computer. You should use comments to leave notes for yourself (and anyone else who might read your code later). -->
<!--This is me making a secret note to myself. -->

<!-- The <head> element contains information that won't be displayed on the page. -->
<head>
  <!-- The <title> element normally sets the name of the browser tab (but in this example codepen's title overrides the title I set) -->
